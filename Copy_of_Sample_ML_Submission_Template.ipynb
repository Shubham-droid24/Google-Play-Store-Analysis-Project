        "**Businesses use sales forecast** to determine what revenue they will be generating in a particular timespan to empower themselves with powerful business plans and strategies. Important decisions such as budgets, hiring, incentives, goals, acquisitions and various other growth plans are affected by the revenue the company is going to make in the coming months and for these plans to be as effective as they are planned to be it is important for these forecasts to also be as good.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Sales forecasting** refers to the process of estimating demand or sales of a particular product over a specific period of time. Sales forecasting is the process of estimating a company’s sales revenue for a specific time period – commonly a month, quarter, or year. Basically,a sales forecast is prediction of how much a company will sell in the future. \n",
        "\n",
        "This project involves solving a real-world business problem of sales forecasting and building up machine learning models for the same. \n",
        "\n",
        "**First,** I have known the Rossmann stores data having two datasets i.e Rossmann Store and Store. We are provided with historical data of 1,115 Rossmann stores in both datasets which were having different columns\n",
        "and one common so, I understood all the variables and how they can be important to the target variable i.e Sales.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Second,** I merge the two datasets for furthur analysis and extracting Year,Month,Day of year and Week of year from the Date column in order to use them for visualization purpose. In visualization, I started from univariate analysis to bivariate and multivariate analysis and in every visualization comparing sales with other variables in order to understand the relation and impact or importance of them.\n",
        "From the visualization, I defined and tested three hypothesis and rejected all of them as p-value was less than significance level.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Third,** I have done preprocessing which is important before model implementation. In this, I handled missing values and outliers\n",
        ", encoding the categorical variables, some feature engineering done to create new features and remove old ones, feature selection on the basis of correlation and multicollinearity. After having selection of important features I transformed some of them, done data splitting and feature scaling. All these were important to be done as they create a great impact on the model performance.     \n",
        "\n",
        "**Last,** I build different models and forecasted the sales for the various Rossmann stores across Europe for the recent six weeks and compared the predicted sales values of different models developed and implemented with the actual sales values. Also, I found out the factors and the most important features required to predict and influence the sales of Rossmann stores.\n",

        "An important assumption of linear regression is homoscedasticity which refers to equal variance in residuals. Unequal variance in residuals, on the other hand, cause heteroscedastic dispersion. In regression analysis, the term ‘residual’ refers to the difference between observed and predicted data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Heteroscedastic dispersion is caused due to the following 2 main reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   It occurs in data sets with large ranges(outliers) and oscillates between the largest and smallest values.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   An improper selection of regression models can cause it.\n",
        "\n",
        "As we have determined while dealing with outliers that outliers are a valid occurrence it would be wise not to treat them by deleting or manipulating them especially when we have established the ups and downs of the target variable in relation to the other features. \n",
        "\n",
        "From the visualization of sales with different features, I came to know that there is seasonality involved and no linear relationship is possible to fit. From the above residual vs fitted plot, u-shape curve indicates that there is non-linearity in the model which can't be explained by the linear regression. For these kinds of datasets, tree based machine learning algorithms can be used which are robust to outlier effect."

R2 score is a metric that tells the performance of your model, not the loss in an absolute sense that how many wells did your model perform. So, with help of R squared we have a baseline model to compare a model which none of the other metrics provides. Basically R2 squared calculates how must regression line is better than a mean line.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hence, R2 squared is also known as Coefficient of Determination or sometimes also known as Goodness of fit. R Square value is between 0 to 1 and a bigger value indicates a better fit between prediction and actual value.\n",

If your regression model has many independent variables, because the model is too complicated, it may fit very well to the training data but performs badly for testing data. That is why Adjusted R Square is introduced because it will penalize additional independent variables added to the model and adjust the metric to prevent overfitting issues.\n",

It is used more commonly than MSE because firstly sometimes MSE value can be too big to compare easily. Secondly, MSE is calculated by the square of error, and thus square root brings it back to the same level of prediction error and makes it easier for interpretation."

R2 score is a metric that tells the performance of your model, not the loss in an absolute sense that how many wells did your model perform. So, with help of R squared we have a baseline model to compare a model which none of the other metrics provides. Basically R2 squared calculates how must regression line is better than a mean line.\n",

If your regression model has many independent variables, because the model is too complicated, it may fit very well to the training data but performs badly for testing data. That is why Adjusted R Square is introduced because it will penalize additional independent variables added to the model and adjust the metric to prevent overfitting issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Mean Squared Error/Root Mean Squared Error**\n",
        "\n",
        "MSE is defined as the Mean of Square of Errors(Actual-Predicted values).\n",
        "While R Square is a relative measure of how well the model fits dependent variables, Mean Square Error(MSE) is an absolute measure of the goodness for the fit.Root Mean Square Error(RMSE) is the square root of MSE. It is used more commonly than MSE because firstly sometimes MSE value can be too big to compare easily. Secondly, MSE is calculated by the square of error, and thus square root brings it back to the same level of prediction error and makes it easier for interpretation."

        "*  Most stores have competition distance within the range of 0 to 10 kms and had more sales than stores far away probably indicating competition in busy locations vs remote locations.\n",
        "*  The positive effect of promotion on Customers and Sales is observable.\n",

        "*  There were more sales on Monday, probably because shops generally remain closed on Sundays which had the lowest sales in a week.\n",

        "\n",
        "*  The outliers in the dataset showed justifiable behaviour. The outliers were either of store type b or had promotion going on which increased sales.\n",

        "1. Average Sales of stores having competition distance upto 10 km is greater than that of stores which are far away(having competition distance greater than 10 km.  \n",
        "2. Average Sales of Store Type 'b' is greater than that of Store Type 'a'.\n",
        "3. Average Sales of Stores having promotion applied i.e Promo = 1 is greater than that of Stores having no promotion applied i.e Promo = 0. \n",

        "**From Model Implementation  :**\n",
        "\n",
        "Random Forest Model using hyperparameter optimization technique(GridSearchCV) gave the best result of R^2 value on test data i.e 0.8---- and only 0.----% improvement was seen from the basic random forest model which indicates that most of the trends and patterns that could be captured by this model without overfitting was done and certainly, a good level of performance was achieved by the model.\n",
